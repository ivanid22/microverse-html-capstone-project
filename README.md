# Zattix: Store Front.

> This is the last project in the HTML/CSS section of the main curriculum in the Microverse Full-Stack Development course. As such, it's been the project where I've tried to pour all the knowledge I've acquired over the entire section of the curriculum.

The assignment for this project was to implement a site for a webstore, following [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX) design structure. All credit on the design goes to Mohammed Awad.
The design layout is great. Simple in scope, but there's a lot of depth in each individual section. This gave me the opportunity to implement almost everything I've learned in this section so far, Namely:

- Working with typographies.
- Alignment and positioning of elements.
- Flex and Grid as display methods for the elements.
- Bootstrap Grid to lay out the main sections of the site.

## Note
To get to the search page of the site, click on "Search" on the index page.
